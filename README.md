# TED-Talks-Text-Analysis-Nick-Sears-Dame-Stephanie-Shirley

## 1. INTRODUCTION
<p align="justify">
This project aims to conduct a text analysis of two TED Talks delivered by Nick Sears and Dame Stephanie Shirley, respectively. Nick Sears’ TED Talk, delivered in 2007, is titled “Demo: The Orb,” while Dame Stephanie Shirley’s TED Talk, delivered in 2015, is titled “Why do ambitious women have flat heads?”.Nick Sears shows how a fully volumetric display can produce a sphere of light with just 256 LEDs. His invention is a modernization of Buckminster Fuller’s 1962 Geoscope, a geodesic sphere with a 200-foot circumference that could show world data and trends through animations.Dame Stephanie Shirley’s TED Talk is about her experiences as a successful businesswoman in a male-dominated industry, and explores why women who are ambitious and successful may face societal pressures to conform and downplay their achievements. The project seeks to answer questions such as number of different facets, the themes they covered, the sentiment they used, and the terms they used most frequently. Additionally, the project will use odds ratio analysis & sentimental analysis to identify the words most strongly connected to each speaker’s speeches, with the ultimate goal of gaining a better understanding of Nick Sears’ and Dame Stephanie Shirley’s viewpoints and ideas.
